export const SMALL_RUMBLE_DESCRIPTION: string = `Rumble is an app intended to fight the sedentary lifestyle which is so common in the 21 century. 
I worked at rumble as a full stack developer using Node js and React. 
My responsibilities varied from creating and maintaining an online tool that makes our database accessible to the non-developers in the company,
 adding new features to the app, creating automatic reports from the data of the company, and much more.
  Since Rumble is still a small company, I had to be very independent in it. 
  When I started working at Rumble, as a second year student, I had to learn React and create an external tool in just 3 months of part time job,  all by myself.
  I feel that this improved my ability to learn new things in an efficient, quick way.`
